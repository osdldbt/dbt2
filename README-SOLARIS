These notes are from testing with OpenSolaris 10.

Install the SFWgplot package for gnuplot from the Solaris 20 companion DVD.

Added the following to your path in order to use gcc (and other development
tools) and to use gnuplot:
    /usr/xpg6/bin:/usr/xpg4/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/sfw/bin:/opt/sfw/bin
