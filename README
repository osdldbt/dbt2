The dbttools package is required for post-processing test data.  This
version of the kit has been proofed against dbttools-v0.1.0.

Please refer to the user manual for instructions on how to use this
package.  After that, read README-* if they apply to your case.

To use the scripts for multi-tier testing, ssh keys needs to be set up
for the user that owns the kit, preferably without a passphrase being
set.  To keep the scripts simple, the kit needs to be installed in the
same location on each system.  Each user must also have sudo privileges,
also preferably without needing a password.  Also review each additional
README-* related to your environment for any additional specific
details.

For multi-node testing, several addition system configurations need to
be make.  See operating system and database specific README's for more
information relating to those environments.

The use of 'ssh' is required and the ssh server needs to allow user
environment processing.  This is because ssh usually has a limited set
of environment variables set.  For example, /usr/local/bin is usually
not in the path when using ssh to execute commands locally.  This is
disabled by default.  To enable, make the following change to the sshd
config file (typically '/etc/ssh/sshd_config') and restart the sshd
server:

PermitUserEnvironment yes
